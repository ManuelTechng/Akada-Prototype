3. User Personas
Primary User: Nigerian student (16-30), tech-savvy, limited budget, 3G internet, seeks affordable programs.
Secondary User: Education counselor in Nigeria, assists students, needs reliable data.
Edge Case: Student with intermittent internet, relies on offline mode.
4. Success Criteria
Usability: 85% of users complete onboarding and search a program within 5 minutes (usability testing).
Performance: Average load time <3s on 3G networks (375px screens).
Data Accuracy: 95% of program data matches real-world sources (manual validation).
Adoption: 500 registered users and 1,000 program searches within 1 month of launch.
Accessibility: Achieve WCAG 2.1 AA compliance (Lighthouse accessibility score >90).
5. Tech Stack
Frontend: React with TypeScript, Tailwind CSS (colors: indigo-600 #4f46e5, gray-800 #1f2937, white #ffffff), Lucide React icons.
Backend: Node.js for server-side logic (e.g., Netlify Functions).
Database: Supabase (real data connections for users, user_preferences, programs, chat_logs, documents, applications tables).
AI Services: xAI Grok 3 API for chat assistance.
Third-Party Services: Paystack/Flutterwave (payments), SendGrid (emails), Calendly (scheduling).
Build Tool: Vite or Create React App (npm run build to build/ or dist/).
Deployment: Netlify with environment variables (SUPABASE_URL, SUPABASE_KEY, API keys).
6. Nigeria-First Requirements
Mobile-First Design: Optimize UI for 375px screens (Tailwind classes: max-w-md, sm:mx-auto).
3G Optimization: Minify assets, lazy-load images, ensure <3s load time.
NGN Localization: Display all costs in NGN (1 USD = 1500 NGN) using toLocaleString('en-NG', { style: 'currency', currency: 'NGN' }).
Offline Capability: Use service workers (public/service-worker.js) to cache data and UI.
Accessibility: Implement ARIA labels, keyboard navigation, 4.5:1 contrast ratio (WCAG 2.1 AA).
Ethical Data: Use only public data, respect robots.txt, avoid personal information.
7. Data Model
Tables in Supabase
users:
id text primary key, email text unique, name text, created_at timestamp.
user_preferences:
user_id text references users(id), goals text, budget_range numeric, countries text[].
programs:
id text primary key, name text, university text, country text, tuition numeric, duration text, specialization text.
Populated with 50+ real programs (e.g., “MSc AI, MIT, USA, ₦30,000,000, 2 years, AI”).
chat_logs:
id text primary key, user_id text references users(id), message text, response text, timestamp timestamp.
documents:
id text primary key, user_id text references users(id), filename text, url text, status text, feedback text.
applications:
id text primary key, user_id text references users(id), program_id text references programs(id), status text, deadline timestamp, notes text.
Data Sources
Real data from university websites (via web scraping app) or manual input.
Initial seeding with 50+ programs, updated weekly.
8. Subscription Model
Free Tier: Basic features (authentication, program search, timeline builder).
Standard Tier ($5/month via Paystack/Flutterwave): AI chat assistance, document review (5 uploads/month).
Premium Tier ($10/month): Unlimited document reviews, application tracking, email reminders.
9. Development Roadmap
Phase 1: Setup and Data (2 Weeks)
Configure Supabase tables and seed with 50+ programs.
Build web scraping app (Node.js) to populate programs table.
Set up Netlify with environment variables.
Phase 2: Core Features (4 Weeks)

10. Risks and Mitigations
Risk: Slow Supabase queries on 3G.
Mitigation: Cache data in localStorage, implement pagination.
Risk: AI API downtime.
Mitigation: Use fallback messages (“Chat unavailable, try again later”).
Risk: Legal issues with scraping.
Mitigation: Adhere to robots.txt, use public data only, consult legal counsel.
Risk: Low adoption.
Mitigation: Offer free tier, partner with Nigerian universities.
