### Phase 3: Testing & Performance (Week 5-6)

#### Quality Assurance
12. **Nigeria-Specific Testing**
    - 3G network simulation and optimization
    - Real device testing with popular Nigerian smartphones
    - User testing with 20 Nigerian students
    - Load testing for 500 concurrent users

13. **Performance Optimization**
    - Sub-3s load time on 3G networks
    - Offline capability for critical features
    - Memory optimization for low-end devices
    - Bundle size optimization and code splitting

14. **Launch Preparation**
    - Bug fixes and performance refinements
    - Documentation for user guides and developer resources
    - Analytics setup for user behavior tracking
    - Deployment pipeline optimization

### Success Criteria
- **Performance**: <3s load time on 3G, >90 Lighthouse score
- **User Experience**: >85% onboarding completion, >4.5/5 satisfaction
- **Adoption**: 500 registered users, 1,000 program searches monthly
- **Accessibility**: WCAG 2.1 AA compliance, >90 accessibility score
- **Recommendations**: >90% match accuracy, improved user engagement

### Tech Stack
- Frontend: React + TypeScript, Tailwind CSS, Lucide React icons
- Database: Supabase with optimized indexes and clean schema
- Performance: Vite, service workers, lazy loading, compression
- Testing: Chrome DevTools 3G simulation, real device testing
- Deployment: Netlify with edge functions and environment optimization

### Risk Mitigation
- **Data Migration**: Careful handling of existing user data during schema changes
- **Performance**: Continuous 3G testing and optimization throughout development
- **User Adoption**: Gradual rollout with A/B testing of new features
- **Technical Debt**: Clean foundation work before building advanced features
