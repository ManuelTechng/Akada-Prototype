# Task ID: 6
# Title: Performance Optimization and Offline Support
# Status: pending
# Dependencies: 1, 5
# Priority: medium
# Description: Setup service worker for offline caching, lazy loading, bundle splitting, and compression pipeline.
# Details:
Implement service worker for caching program data. Add lazy loading for images and heavy components. Configure bundle splitting for 3G optimization. Create compression pipeline for Nigerian internet conditions.

# Test Strategy:
Test offline access and caching. Measure load times on 3G network simulations. Verify bundle size reduction and compression effectiveness.
