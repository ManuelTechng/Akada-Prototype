# Task ID: 8
# Title: Smart Dashboard Widgets and Data Visualization
# Status: in-progress
# Dependencies: 3, 5
# Priority: medium
# Description: Implement profile completion tracker, application timeline, smart recommendations, and cost comparison charts. Integrate comprehensive data layer hooks and services for real-time, personalized insights.
# Details:
Leverage the completed dashboard data layer with smart hooks and services: useProfileCompletion (tracks 5-section completion with Nigerian-specific next steps), useApplicationTimeline (deadline tracking with urgency detection), useCostAnalysis (budget analysis with NGN calculations), useSmartDashboard (aggregates all insights with priority ranking), and useCostVisualization (chart data prep for cost breakdowns and country comparisons). All hooks utilize the unified preference service and optimized database. Prepare for UI integration once Cursor delivers components.

# Test Strategy:
Test all dashboard hooks and services with mock and real user data. Verify that profile completion, timeline urgency, cost analysis, and recommendations are accurate and update in real time. Ensure chart data is correct for NGN and country comparisons. Confirm readiness for seamless UI integration.
