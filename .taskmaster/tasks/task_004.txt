# Task ID: 4
# Title: Nigeria-First Design System and Component Library
# Status: pending
# Dependencies: 1
# Priority: medium
# Description: Create Akada design tokens, responsive utilities, dark mode, and 3G-optimized component library.
# Details:
Define design tokens for typography, colors, and spacing with NGN formatting. Build responsive utilities for 375px mobile optimization. Implement dark mode infrastructure. Create a library of 3G-optimized UI components.

# Test Strategy:
Test components on mobile devices and 3G network simulations. Verify responsive behavior and dark mode toggling. Check component library integration.

# Subtasks:
## 1. Implement NGN Currency Formatting System [done]
### Dependencies: None
### Description: Develop a robust utility for formatting and displaying Nigerian Naira (NGN) values across all UI components, ensuring consistency and localization.
### Details:
Create a currency formatting module that handles NGN-specific symbols, decimal precision, and localization rules. Integrate this utility into the design system so all components referencing currency use this standardized approach.

## 2. Define Akada Design System Tokens [done]
### Dependencies: 4.1
### Description: Establish a comprehensive set of design tokens for typography, color palette (including dark mode variants), and spacing, tailored for Nigerian digital products.
### Details:
Create a token file (JSON, SCSS, or JS) specifying font families, font sizes, weights, color variables (primary, secondary, accent, background, etc.), and spacing scales. Ensure tokens are easily consumable by both CSS and JS. Include NGN-specific typographic considerations.

## 3. Develop Mobile-First Responsive Program Card Components [pending]
### Dependencies: 4.2
### Description: Build reusable, mobile-optimized program card components using the defined design tokens, focusing on 375px width and touch-friendly interactions.
### Details:
Design and implement card components that prioritize content, use intuitive navigation patterns, and are optimized for touch input. Ensure cards are responsive, visually clear at 375px, and leverage Akada tokens for styling. Include support for NGN currency display.

## 4. Set Up Dark Mode Infrastructure [pending]
### Dependencies: 4.2
### Description: Implement a dark mode system that allows seamless switching between light and dark themes, leveraging the design tokens for color adaptation.
### Details:
Configure CSS variables or a theme provider to toggle between light and dark color tokens. Ensure all components and utilities respond to theme changes. Provide a mechanism for user/system preference detection.

## 5. Create Performance Optimization Utilities [pending]
### Dependencies: 4.3, 4.4
### Description: Develop utilities and guidelines to ensure all components and assets are optimized for 3G network conditions, focusing on speed and minimal payload.
### Details:
Implement lazy loading for images, use SVGs for icons, and optimize asset sizes. Provide helper functions for responsive images and code splitting. Document best practices for 3G optimization within the library.

## 6. Set Up 3G-Optimized Component Library Infrastructure [pending]
### Dependencies: 4.5
### Description: Establish the foundational structure for the Akada component library, ensuring all components are modular, tree-shakable, and optimized for low-bandwidth usage.
### Details:
Configure the library build system (e.g., using Rollup or Vite) for modular exports and minimal bundle size. Set up documentation and storybook/demo environment. Integrate performance utilities and ensure all components use Akada tokens and NGN formatting.
